# DUContainerMonitor
- Click on the file DUContainerMonitor.config and then select the raw tab. Select the config
source and then within Dual Universe paste it to a Programming Board.
- Add a medium Screen by linking from the Probramming Board to the Screen.
- Add up to 6 containers.
- Edit the lua parameters, set the screen title, set the screen id, set the names, ids and other properties for each container. Each container should only contain a single type of item.

- A Detection Zone connected to the programming board can turn on the Programming Board and turn it off again when player leaves the detection zone.
